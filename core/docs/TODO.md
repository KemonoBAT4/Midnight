# The TODO list --- (TEMP FILE)
To-Do list for developing new features

- [X] if its possible move the `database.js` schemas imported in a specific file, then import only the db function and make the request from the file specific to the schema selected

- [ ] update the midnight.js and then remove the `temp-database-main.js` and `temp-widgets.js`

(this will be replaced with issues)
